This is Palm::ThinkDB, a Perl module for reading and modifying ThinkDB
version 2 database files.  ThinkDB is the property of thinkingBytes
Technology.

WARNING:  This is ALPHA SOFTWARE.  It has might corrupt data, destroy
TinyBytes, and be incredibly incompatable with whatever version of
ThinkDB you're using.  I've only tested it with ThinkDB 2.0, and it
doesn't even support all of those fields yet.

Please send me e-mail and let me know how this software package works
for you.  I can be reached at erik@aarg.net.
